//Start from here

The moment Arun read those words he felt something enter his body going to his stomach, moments later a burning sensation started growing in his stomach, so he dropped the book and grabbed his stomach

”Aghhh”

Soon his stomach started hurting, it felt like something was growing inside of him

“What the hell”

Still writhing, he looked at the book and more characters started appearing, narrating what happened to Arun from waking up, to the current pain in his stomach but the narration went further

‘I was writhing in pain as my origin pool opens up’

“Origin pool?”

The book describes the pain in his stomach as an opening of origin pool

“The hell is an origin pool”

At his question, more words appeared in the book

‘With an origin pool, I would be able to store and use the power of my origin’

“No shit Sherlock, what the hell is an origin ’Auugh’”

Arun couldn’t bear the increasing pain and was barely holding up his consciousness

‘My origin will allow me to change and bend the laws of the fate of the world’

“What?!”

Arun passed out and lay on the grass his mind full of questions, fear and worry

—

He was woken up by drops of water on his face

“No way”

Looking up, the sky was getting darker and the rain started pouring, his clothes getting wetter with every second, he frantically looked around for cover, his body trembled with fear, his breathing became heavy as his traumatic memories reappeared in his mind, and then his eyes got set on the mysterious book which was still dry, its paper was as crisp and smooth as they were before

‘sigh’

That book was trouble especially after whatever it did to his stomach, the origin pool or whatever, but that book is his only cover right now

He hesitated but his fear of rain controlled his body, he quickly picked up the book and covered his head

When he stopped feeling the water dropping on his head only then he was able to calm down

He didn’t move from his place even though he was soaking and it was getting cold

In an unknown place with the sky getting dark, moving might as well be suicide

And the water and cold didn’t bother him that much as long as his head wasn’t getting wet by rain

He looked up at the book and flipped the page to the first few page

And more words appeared on it and as before these new words were narrating what happened till now

“What are you”

Nothing appeared in the book, he was hoping that like before it would answer him but nothing happened

“Where am I”

“What kind of world is this”

“What should I do now”

“Why aren’t you telling me anything”

“Answer me”

He waited but again nothing happened, instead of answering his questions the book just narrated what he just said and did.

‘sigh’

Tired and still recovering from the pain of his ‘origin pool’ opening up he placed the book on his head and folded his leg wrapping his arms around them, he closed his eyes, becoming as still as possible as to not attract any kind of danger

He opened his eyes as if a sudden realization hit him

“Why am I so cool-headed about all this craziness”

Certainly, if he looks back at his reaction from the start, it wasn’t normal for someone in this situation

‘I woke up in this unknown grassland, this place probably is a different fucking world, I found a weird book that was narrating what I did and it opened my ‘ori..gin pool’? or something like that, that pool will allow me to use my ‘origin’, that origin can bend the laws of the fate of the world, then I passed out from the pain and after waking up from the rain I am now using that same weird book to cover my head like it’s nothing’

“What the fuck”

There is definitely something wrong with me.

“’Augh’ thinking about all this is hurting my head”

His fatigue finally caught up to his body, his eyes became heavy

‘I can’t sleep not here in the world’

But he wasn’t strong enough to fight it and slowly went to sleep

—

‘Achoo’ ‘sniff’

Waking up from a running nose he looked around

“’hehe’ I am still alive”

Laughing at himself he took a breath of relief from not being attacked by anything in his sleep

Looking up at the clear bright sky, he took the book from his head and decided to read what the book wrote

‘My eyes were heavy, dead tired I couldn’t resist the fatigue taking over my body and went to sleep’

‘In the middle of the night a ‘Crisis’ got too close to me but instead of doing something to me it ignored me and went on its own way’

A cold sweat went down his spine after reading that

Something called ‘Crisis’ went past him, he was completely defenseless, he could have died

“But it ignored me?”

Did it not recognize me as a target or maybe something like that or the ‘Crisis’ wasn’t interested in me

He read the line again

“The way it is written is weird, it’s like the ‘Crisis’ was coming towards me but it suddenly ignored me”

He continued reading further

‘The book saved me in the night and then I woke up from my running nose’

“What?”

He read that line again

“How did this book save me”

It is a weird book with a kind of power in it but how it saved me, is it alive

“No that can’t be ‘hahaha’, ‘hmm’”

A page from the middle of the book fell off,

He picked it up and on it, there was something written in a different language but unlike before he didn’t get an understanding of these words

“The book saved me”

‘Is this what the book is talking about, is this some kind of spell that made the ‘Crisis’ ignore me’

He looked back at the page to see if the book would answer him, but found no answer to his questions

‘sigh’

“If a creature came here then this might be a path to them, there is no guarantee they won’t come back, I need to go somewhere else”

But where to go was the real question

He again looked at the book and then sighed

“You probably won’t tell me what to do, you will just narrate what is happening or what had happened”

So instead he placed the book on the ground and kept it standing, then he let go of his hand and the book fell pointing to his left

“I will go left then”

He stood up and picked up the book with him

Before he moved he gave the book a look and a thought formed in his mind

“Just calling you a ‘book’ doesn’t sound good though, you still saved me so I think I should give you a name”

He gave the book a serious look before coming up with a name

“Because you have been narrating what happened, I will call you”

“Narrator”

“I have never been able to be a part of a story, but I can now, with you”

“I hope you write my story, Narrator”

Thus Arun took his first real step into this unknown world, scared worried and excited to see what kind of story he would live and tell
