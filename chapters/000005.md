//Write from here 

After that race at the school, Aditi started challenging me everyday, coming to my house with something new.
Along with her few more kids came, and I found myself as the leader of our little group.

Every Saturday we hold a group study session, mostly me helping them in their studies though.
Mom put some snacks and juice in my room, few minutes later the bell rang and I opend the door for them.

"Hello, Ashwin" Said Aditi.

I nodded as they got inside and we all went to my room.

Inside they sat around the table, and opend thier notebooks, I went  around giving them snacks and juice and then also sat down.

"Ashiwn" called Adtiti. pointing at a question in her notebook.
"I dont understand this"

I looked over and helped her solve it, then my helped my other friends.
This is how its been for the last few days, the questions are simple for me because of my knowledge from the past.
