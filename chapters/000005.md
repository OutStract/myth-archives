After that race at the school, Aditi started challenging me everyday, coming to my house with something new.
Along with her few more kids came, and I found myself as the leader of our little group.

Every Saturday we hold a group study session, mostly me helping them in their studies though.
Mom put some snacks and juice in my room, few minutes later the bell rang and I opend the door for them.

"Hello, Ashwin" Said Aditi.

I nodded as they got inside and we all went to my room.
