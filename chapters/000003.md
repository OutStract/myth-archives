It’s been 5 months since my birth, living my life as a normal infant doing things on impulse, crying, dirtying myself, trying my best not to worry them by doing something different and not child-like.

At first, it was hard to adjust to this body with how limited things I can do, and trying to control myself from pooping, after getting tired I let things flow ‘naturally’ without a care in the world just like now.

Maaaaaaaa calling my mother for help.

***

“Ashwin mom has to cook, Please let mom cook,” Mom said trying to free me from herself.

boohoo but I refused to let go I didn’t want to leave my parents for even a second, then dad entered the kitchen and started laughing. 

“Hey Kartik don’t just stand there laughing, and take care of Ashwin until I am done with cooking.” Mom ordered dad 

“Yes-yes, Ashwin, come here” Dad took me from mom and mom taking a sigh of relief started preparing breakfast. 

“Ashwin why don’t you let go of mom huh,” Dad asked me with a confused face. 

“What about me? I am your dad. You know? why you don’t want to be held by me.” Now he is making a sad and confused face.

The answer is simple, his sharp beard stings a lot, especially with my soft skin, but Dad thinks it’s fine to rub his beard on my soft cheeks, he even enjoys that.

“Just why Ashwin?”

He was about to rub his beard again I started slapping his cheeks away In protest.

“boobooobboobobo” But failed, I cried to Mom for help but she ignored me.

My Grandma, and Grandpa entered the kitchen. I cried to them for help but they just laughed it off.

“Booooooooooo” (somebody help meeeee).

After becoming 2 years old I got a lot more comfortable with my life now being able to do a lot more things and have less physical limitations and more self-control, I am at a stage where it wouldn’t be weird for me to talk a lot, so I have been making the most out of it talking to my parents about all sorts of things but also acting like a normal boy playing with children of my own age and also planning my future and how to make the most out of my time as a child and decided that I shouldn’t neglect my studies just because I don’t have to do them now but the efforts I put in now will pay off in the future and also learning other skill like drawing and singing because I don’t really need to buy anything specific for them and also make more friends because in the past life I stayed an introvert for like 10 to 12 years always thinking that it’s too late to change how I am but with a fresh start I am going to go all out, oh, and also I am doing light exercise to strengthen my body for when I start learning some martial art so yeah that’s about it for my life goals for now

As for this time-travel thing that happened to me, I have no idea what happened?, Did my consciousness traveled to another parallel dimension because I got hit real hard by the truck just thinking about this and remembering my death shakes me to my core, or did some godly being did this, did I time leaped into the past, or become a guinea pig for a scientific experiment or something, do I have some kind of mysterious power I don’t know about

I tried looking into different articles, news reports, different documentaries, searched the internet for people with similar experiences, going to the library with my grandfather scraping any piece of paper I could find and reading them so intensely that Grandpa got curious asking me if I even understand them and I could only answer with a big NO because it was all wasted effort at the end of the day most of them either turned out to be hoaxed for publicity or theories without any example or proof

So I stopped caring about it and just accepted the fact that I am living my life all over again

But I still find it an interesting thing to study so I will probably continue studying ‘time’ as a hobby

***

I have friends, I really do, it’s a different thing they act like a gang and made me a leader and the 4-year-old girl beating the crap out of other of her classmates is also one of my friends “You better think twice before entering our turf” the girl threatens her classmates holding their collars and throwing them on the ground “vice-captain is so cool” the other children in my *friend group* cheered for their vice-captain for teaching the enemy gang a lesson

Are these kids really kids, Shouldn’t kids be innocent and stupid these kids are scary

And their vice-captain is even scarier she is like a wild beast

The wild beast walks towards us and the children she just beat up are running away with wet pants they were looking too pitiful, so I pray to God for their well-being

“Ashwin why don’t you teach them who owns this area” the wild beast asks me

“Isn’t it fine to let them play like they should because unlike some gang out there those kids are still kids” I answered

“Hmph you are way too kind showing them mercy, You don’t know when they will take over our area it’s better to teach them who rules this land as soon as possible”

‘Rules this land? this is a school playground that belongs to the SCHOOL and what do you mean by teaching them and giving them PTSD at such a young age?, Let them live their childhood’ Of course I can’t say this to her face I am too scared to do that

Just how did she end up like this? In my previous life, we were still neighbors but I rarely left my house so I never got to know her, We only met when someone in the neighborhood invited everyone to their birthday or any other celebration and we only talked minimally we were strangers at best and later she become the topper at school in basically everything and I was living my life as an average human taking care of my grandma but from what I remember about her, She wasn’t this wild she was much more reserved then how just how did she turn out this way

Am I at fault here?

***

It all started when I was celebrating my 3rd year birthday and my parents invited everyone from the neighborhood

That was when I met her

Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you ………

After blowing off the candle on the cake as everyone was finished singing the birthday song I cut the cake and fed the slice to my family, After that everyone invited to the party gave me the gifts they brought I knew a lot of the kids that came there were some new faces

Thanking everyone for coming I took a look around the room the make sure that everyone got the snacks and juices Then a little girl sitting in the corner of the room caught my eyes

She wasn’t eating anything and just sat there silently

I prepared a plate for her with food and juice

“You don’t want some” I asked the girl

She was shocked for a second before accepting it “Thank you” she said looking at me with a puzzled face wondering who I am, I guess

“Ashwin, my name is Ashwin, and you?”

“Aditi” She looked down at the plate in her hand and took a bite

Taking a seat beside her “Did you come alone” I asked looking around the room, Most of the guests and kids came with their friends and parents but she was sitting alone so I asked her out of curiosity

“I came with my parents there they are” she pointed towards the people that were talking to my parents

“Wait you are from the house right beside ours” I know the people she was pointing towards they often came over and talked about their daughter but never really brought their daughter with them

My parents and those people always talk about who was better their daughter or me

After hearing all sorts of amazing things about their daughter I got curious about her, Is the girl beside me really her

“Yes they are my parents and I am your neighbor” so she really is her but why does she look annoyed

“Then why didn’t you come over with your parents I didn’t really see you outside either” That’s the part I am curious about

“Because it’s a waste of time,” she said with an annoyed look

“What?” I asked confused

“I said it’s a waste of time to play with kids I would rather study than waste my important time playing and doing stupid things.” She’s surprisingly talkative

“Heeee I see but like wouldn’t it be great having some friends”

“Friends are not needed hmph“

“Why do you think that”

“I already told you that studying at home is better than wasting time with friends as I thought you were also a stupid kid for not being able to understand even something so simple hmph“

“I guess that’s true but it’s also true that you are also a kid”

“Hmph comparing me to those kids just shows how stupid you are If you can only think that far then you won’t be able to become anything in your life” She is getting on my nerves now calling me stupid again and again

“Tell this stupid me why do you think you are smarter than me or any other kid”

“Hmph Not being able to see the difference between our IQs already makes you stupid and I have no reason to answer your stupid question” Yep I am done with her

“Well then have fun by yourself and I will have fun with my stupid friends” I left with a dry laugh there’s no need for me to try and reason with a kid

***

I have a lot of questions right now and the first one would be why is Aditi following me

I left her because she was too smart but now she is following me

After getting fed up with her I asked what she wanted but she answered with ‘You are in my way’

So I kindly gave her, her way and walked my own way to my friends but she started following me again

“Who is she Ashwin,” a friend of mine asked

“My tail… I mean she is Aditi, my neighbour”

“Ashwin did you do something for her to keep following you” another of my friend asked with others having question marks on their face

“I don’t think I did anything as far as I remember”

I looked back at her “What” she said with annoyance “Do you want something from me” I asked her again “You are in my”

“That won’t work anymore princess” Before she could say the same damn thing again I cut her off, I have to cut her off, I already reached my limit

“What is it that you want from me” I asked with a heavy voice, looking straight at her

She seemed a bit frightened for a second but regained her composer and opened her mouth “Mom and Dad always talked about how smart you are and always wanted me to befriend you, that’s why I am observing you to see how good you really are” she puffed her chest out acting like she has authority now

Looking at her I can’t help but facepalm myself ‘This is stupid’ I am already getting tired of talking to her

“So did you find out how smart I am” I shouldn’t get angry at a child I am an adult getting angry at a child won’t give me anything

“Hmph Of course but I have to test you first tomorrow after school I will come again with a test Bye” and she left with her parents just like that

I looked at my friends they just laughed by themselves and left and the party came to an end just like that

“So she will come again tomorrow sigh“

***

“Ashwin I challenge you”

I am reading an excellent book about scientific theories and an annoying voice of a girl shouting comes from behind me

Looking back Aditi is standing there puffed chest and a confident smile giving me a feeling of nothing but trouble

Ignoring her I resumed reading

She came running in front of me

“Let’s race,” she said all excited

“Don’t want to” Without looking up I answered flatly

“Are you running away because you are afraid of losing giggles“

“…….” I don’t have to answer her, Staying silent will be better She will left on her own, or so I thought but she snatched my book

“If you want it back you will have to win the race,” she said smirking

“sigh fine” although as pain in the ass she is, she probably won’t trouble me if I win once

Standing side by side with a lot of children gathered around watching us

“GO!” a boy shouted

Right after that, we started running and Aditi ran past me

“She is running at a dangerous speed” With how uneven the ground is running too fast can cause you to trip but she doesn’t seem to understand that

She tripped soon after passing me and I just ran past her

Looking back she is holding her, knees about to cry

Winning like this doesn’t feel right so I also get back to her

“You okay” Extending my arm I asked her

She looked up at me and started crying

A teacher came running to us and picked up Aditi taking her to the infirmary

“At the end of the day, she is still a child,” Looking at the teacher carrying Aditi I said this to myself.
