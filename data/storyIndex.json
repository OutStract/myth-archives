    "synopsis": "Arun a ordinary high school kid who loves reading, he read all types of stories from children's tales to mythological epics, but non of them really made him feel anything, other people said that they found themselves immersed in a story, but for Arun he was just reading some words written on a page, never being immersed in a story, he kept reading just to find that one story that would pull Arun in it's world. One day, he woke up and found himself lying in a grasslands. He thought it was a dream because he had gone to sleep in his room, but his experience after reading so many stories, he realised that he had been transported to another world, and thought, “In this world, I will write my own story” After reading all the stories the world has to offer, Arun developed an ability to judge other people and think calmly in any situation, because he thinks even the world has a story, and all the stories he read are inspired by the world. Art imitates life after all."
